  <h1>Notes for Stage 0</h1><p><b>Basics of the Web</b></p>

<p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> is a collection of html (hypertext markup language) documents. Hyperlinks connect the documents. Major components are a user's computer, 
the internet, and servers. A browser on the computer allows the user to interact with the internet. HTTP protocol allows the internet to communicate with servers.

<p><b>Markup</b> is made up of "tags"(opening and closing), and "elements" are strings of tagged content. Content includes attributes, and each attribute has a "value." For instance, 
Anchor tags are for making links. Image tags are for displaying images. Images don't have closing tags. A "void tag" has no content. Some tags, such as span, are inline; 
others, such as div, are block. These are container elements, and their purpose is to contain content inside themeselves. This is yet another
